# I. Intro
## 1. project introduction
Project **ProblemShooter** is a **java** project that 
1) **reads** problem bank **files**,
2) **chooses** random problems out of them,
3) and **print** it as a <code>.txt</code> **file**

**notification :** this project is **not about troubleshooting;** this program literally 'shoots problems' to the output file.

## 2. project motivation
This project was first **suggested by corpral Cho.** He wanted to study with sample exams, which was **unavailable in the market.** He already had the problem bank; the only problem was that he had to choose problems himself and make the exam sheet. It was both **bothering and time-taking.**
That's when I heard this story. I thought it will be **a great chance to revive my Java coding skills and keep it sharp.** 
I was quite confident about it, for in my highschool years, **I had developed one just like it.** It was a program that **erases given keywords** from the passage to **make a fill-blanks exam** sheet.

## 3. keyword Definition
#### 1) big index, small index
This is my own comprehension of naming category levels. For example, this part is in big index 1, small index 3. The bank Mr.Cho provided had only two levels.
#### 2) (to) shoot problems
This term means this project is "exporting each problem content to the output channel.' By problem content, I mean (1) question, (2) answer, (3) and a list of wrong choices.

#### 3) IterateIndex
In this project, each index chosen is driven by objects named <code>IterateIndex</code>. This object has <code>bigIndex,smallIndex</code> as attributes, and some methods for driving them. 

# II. Project Overview

## process #1. get grasp of bank status
In the directory, a <code>.txt</code> file named <code>chapters.txt</code> has the number of small indexes for each big indexes.
## process #2. choose random small indexes
## process #3. load random problems of chosen indexes
## process #4. export them

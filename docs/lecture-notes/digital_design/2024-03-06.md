**concept is the number. **
** Its representation written down works on base-r system. **

### How do we convert into new base system?
> divide by base, and remainder repeatedly is written from the right.

#### How do we do conversion easily on our brain?
subtract the biggest subtractable geometric progression of the base.

## Fraction conversion
> multiply by base, and take the integer.

>The only purpose of using octal numbers or hexadecimal is for compression

# complements
### Diminished radix complement
* (r-1)'s complement of N :
	$(r^n-1)-N$
* r's complement of N:
	$(r^n) -N$

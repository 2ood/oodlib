# Signed Binary Numbers

## Signed-magnitude.
* The first digit refers to the sign of the data.
* N digit signed-magnitude number is at most $-2^{n-1}+1 < = sA < = 2^{n-1}-1$
* first digit 1 is negative, 0 is positive.
* There is two zero representations. 100000. or 000000.

> We want to solve the problem that the magnitude is separated with its sign. 
> We want just simple bit-wise addition possible. 
> numerically integrate the sign and its magnitude. 


## Complement
diminished radix compelemnt, radix complement

1's complement, just reverse the bits.

2's complement, get 1's complement and add 1. 



Computational impact

#### Data distributions
prevent data

## Packed, unpacked

packed each decimal stored in 4 bits.

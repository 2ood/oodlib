# RECAP

## Kleene's Theorem : revisited

**************
# Construction of String Recognisers

## Thompson's construction
* NFA will have exactly 1 start, 1 accepting state.
* Inductively $R_1|R_2$ and $R_1 * R_2$ , and $R^*$are defined.

## Subset construction
If there's another state reachable without consuming a symbol(that is, connected by $\epsilon$),we can merge the states and denote possible states in subset notation.

## $\epsilon$-Closure (of $I$)
> The set of states reachable from $I$ without consuming any symbols.

* itself is contained.
* For multiple states in $I$, it is induced by computing the union of each state's $\epsilon$-closure.

# Topological Sort
Can be solved by post order DFS. if the input is DAG. directed acyclic graph?
Start from the node without any dependency. 

## Kahn's Algorithm
1) First calculate in-order numbers for each nodes. 
	This helps you to find the minimum dependency nodes. 
2) push the no dependency node to the queue. 
3) By queue, start a topological sort starting from the popped node. 
4) For neighbor nodes, decrease the in-order numbers.
5) go to step 2 until the queue is empty.

# Test prewrap

* choice diagram.
* table for recursions. tabulations

* practice pseudocode


* huffman coding, put the smaller nodes to the left. (follow the book)
* practice dijstra algortihm with the table.
* limitations of dijstra algorithm, and how you can solve it.

* Terminologies important.
* graph representations important

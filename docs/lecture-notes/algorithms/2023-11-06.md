# Matrix Chain Multiplication

## Tabulation
We make two matrices
One is for cost tracking, the other is for paranthesis cuttitng index backtracking.

* Cells of `i=j`, it means one single matrix, so diagonals are zero.
* Each cell means that the minimum cost of $A_{i+1}$ through $A_{j+1}$ 
* we will calculate first from semidiagonals that are closer to main diagonal, outwards.
* Our final cost will be at `[0][n-1]` th cell.

* for multiple calculations, you will check possible options and find the minimum.
* At the second matrix, you will write the index you put the paranthesis.


# Longest Common Subsequence
What is the common subsequence?
character should appear in the same order.

problem statement
given two string. 
find characters that are in the same sequence inside each string, and print the max length of it. 
## Recursion
we make a function `LCS(String x, String y, int n, int m)`
base case : when  $n=0 \text{ or}\;m=0$ 
Decreasing function : from last character, move to the next character and reduce the size.

If matched, increase the result +1.
If not matched, decrease n or decrease m. choose whichever that gives the longest result.

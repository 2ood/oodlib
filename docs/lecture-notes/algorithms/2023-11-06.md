# Matrix Chain Multiplication

## Tabulation
We make two matrices
One is for cost tracking, the other is for paranthesis cuttitng index backtracking.

* Cells of `i=j`, it means one single matrix, so diagonals are zero.
* Each cell means that the minimum cost of $A_{i+1}$ through $A_{j+1}$ 
* we will calculate first from semidiagonals that are closer to main diagonal, outwards.
* Our final cost will be at `[0][n-1]` th cell.

* for multiple calculations, you will check possible options and find the minimum.
* At the second matrix, you will write the index you put the paranthesis.

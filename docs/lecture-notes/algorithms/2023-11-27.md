# Huffman Coding
Characters that are more frequent needs less code.

# Minimum Cost Spanning Tree
> finding the spanning tree that has minimum cost.

## Spanning Tree
* The tree that touches all the nodes with minimum number of edges
* Do not have any loops.

> **The # of edges = (# of nodes) -1**

## representation of a Graph
G = (V,E), where V = {1,2,3,4,5,6} , E = {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,6),(6,1)}

* There is only one minimum cost spanning tree.
* There is only one minimum cost


## Prim's Minimum Cost Spanning Tree

1) select the minimum cost edge
2) Select the **next** minimum cost edge among already connected nodes.
3) repeat stage 2 until the number of edges become (# nodes -1)

## Kruskal's Minimum Cost Spanning Tree

> Select the next minimum, but not if you make up a cycle. In that case, take the next minimum instead.

time complexity $O(E*E)$

If you take the heap, it can be reduced to $O(E \log{E})$

## Use case on Non-Connected Graphs
> Kruskals. The Prims will not able to discover the other isolated nodes.

# Dijkstra's Algorithm
>Single Source shortest path problem

The shortest path weight from a selected source node to the each other nodes.

* initialize the not-directly-connected paths with infinity.
* **Relaxation** : exchanging/taking the less costed path.

# Matrix Chain Multiplication

## Recursion
algorithm idea development.
We build a `MCM(arr[], i, j)` recursion function. 

* `i` should start from 1, and each `i`-th matrix $A_{i}$ is `arr[i-1]` by `arr[i]` size.
* **base case** is when i and j are the same. cost is 0.
*  iteration of `k`,
	* `k` goes from `i` to `j-1`.
	* `k=j` is not possible because the splitting happens like this : $MCM(arr,i,k) + MCM(arr,k+1,j)$
	* cost of breaking at k is $MCM(arr,i,k) + MCM(arr,k+1,j)+ (i-1)*k*j$
* iterate k, and keep track of the minimum cost.

## problems based on MCM
* MCM
* printing MCM
* Evaluate Expression to True/Boolean Paranthesization
* Min/Max value of an Expression ex. `2*3+5` ->`2*(3+5)`
* Palindrome Partitioning ex. `aab`-> `[["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]`
* Scramble String
* Egg Dropping Problem.

>base case on Recursion becomes the initial value of tabulation.

# BFS
> siblings are visited before children
Time complexity $O(V+E)$


# DFS
> children are visited before siblings
## pre-order and post-order traversal
1) pre-order : add the node to output when first visited(=when pushing into the stack)
2) post-order : add the node to output when there's no unexplored subnodes.


# Topological Sort
> input should be **directed graph with no cycle.**

> Excecute task which dependencies has been completed.

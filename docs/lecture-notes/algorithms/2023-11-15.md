# Heap
* Binary tree
* Array representation of binary tree
* Complete binary tree

## Binary tree
height, 
depth 0 is root, depth 1 is the next level, ..

## Array representation
> store higher leaves first, left to right.

Wee need to preserve..
1) Element value itself
2) parent-child relationship.

If a node is at node `i`
the left child is at `2*i`, right child is at `2*i+1`, its parent is at `[i/2]`

## Full binary tree
> every leaves of height is filled.
> `2^h-1` Nodes
> height is log n ? 
## Complete binary tree
> there should be no empty parts in array representation

up is a complete binary tree. down is not a complete binary tree.


# Max heap & Min heap
Max heap is 
* a complete binary tree
* parent element are always bigger than child

Min heap is
* a complete binary tree
* parent element are always smaller than child.

**This doen't mean that heap is a sorted array.**
**They only guarantee the min, or max value.

## Insertion operation in MaxHeap
> You first insert the new element **at the bottom, and move to the top**

compare with parent, and if parent is smaller, swap.
This way, the property of **complete binary tree** is preserved.

#### Time complexity of insertion
The time complexity of insertion is **$O(\log{n})$** at maximum, which is the height of the tree.
minimum O(1), maximum **$O(\log{n})$**

## Removal operation in Max Heap.
> you only pop the top of the heap.

popping is easy, but you need to readjust the remaining elements.

How to readjust?
> end element move to the front, and compare with the children.

#### Time complexity of removal&readjust.
The time complexity of readjustment is minimum O(1), maximum **$O(\log{n})$**

# HeapSort
>if you pop element one by one from a heap and combine it, it results a sorted array.

![[Pasted image 20231115152534.png]]
we do n removal&readjust. so time complexity is $O(n\log n)$.

#todo :write about time complexity, and comparison

# Heapify
> Adjusting downwards

heap creating time complexity to $O(n)$

From the back element, check if the downards tree is a heap.
Else, make it a heap.
number of swaps for each height is $log n$...?

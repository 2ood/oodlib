# IPv6
* out of 40 bytes header, 32 bytes are used for source IP, destination IP.
* Fragmentation header fields are omitted. 
* How do they handle big MTU fragmentation? The router sends back a request of a smaller MTU. fragmentation is done in the end user device. 
* option fields are omitted. The header size is now fixed.

## How was IPv6 transition done?
> Tunnelling

* IPv6 datagram carried as payload in IPv4 datagram among IPv4 routers
* used extensively in 4G/5G

source and destination IP of IPv4 headers will be the IPv6-supporting routers.

# Generalized Forwarding, SDN

* forwarding table for generalized forwarding is called **flow table**
* flow tables are defined by controllers.
* **Match plus action**
	* many header fields are accessed and used.
	* many action possible : drop/copy/modify/log packet

## Flow table abstraction
* flow : defined by header field values : mac(link), IP (network), port(transport)

* generalized forwarding
	* match
	* actions
	* priority
	* counters

## OpenFlow
> protocol of exchanging these flow table infos.

1) Implement what destination-based forwarding did:
2) example ) firewall functionality
3) example) layer2 destination-based forwading

## Match-action
1) Router functionality
2) Switch functionality
3) Firewall functionality
4) NAT functionality


# Middlebox
Any intermediate devices that gives extra functionality to the network.
It alleviates the thin waist problem of the Internet.

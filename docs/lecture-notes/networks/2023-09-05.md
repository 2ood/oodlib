# Recap
## Access Networks : Digital Subscriber line(DSL)
* replaced by fiber optics connections

## Packet switches
* files are divided into chunks
* chunks are padded with headers,  where it has info on destination & source
* the core route & forward the packets.
* Routing algorithm tells us which packet from which subnet should be routed to which another core.

## Store-and Forward
not forwarded until the whole ENTIRE packet is ALL received. 
receive AND THEN start forwarding. 

## Alternative to Packet Switching: circuit switching
* call setup time. 
* guarantees performance. 
* circuit still reserved event if not used by call. idle state. not shared circuit.

## Multiplexing techniques
### FDM
allocated own band
### TDM
allocated own time slot

# Packet Switching vs. Circuit Switching

|  |Packet switch|Circuit Switch|
|-|---|---|
|users max|can do more than 10|max. 10|
|probability of being 10 active| `< 0.004`|-|

#todo 1: write about packet switching advantages

# Structure of internet

![[../images/20230905134236.png]]
* not contected one-by-one. It does not scale efficiently.
* ISPs connected to end access net.
*
* ISP - IXP - ISP (exchanging through IXP)
* ISP - ISP (peering link)


**IXP**
Internet exchange points, ususally under governement control

**regional ISP**
useful in efficiency in remote areas, 

**Tier-1 ISP**
national & international coverage

**Content service providers**
private network that connects its data centers to Internet, often **bypassing** tier-1, regional ISPs

## Delay, Packet loss, throughput
### Delay
**transmission delay**: 
* caused by <u>bandwidth</u>
* about bandwidth, per one hop
* *$L/R$ seconds to transmit $L$ bit packet into link at $R$ bps. 

**propagation delay**: 
* caused by <u>length of link</u>
* $d/s$ , where $d$ is length of physical link, $s$ is propagation speed(ex. light speed)

**queueing delay**:
* caused by <u>conjestions</u>
* **packet loss** happens.
	* when arrival rate exceeds transmission rate
	* because of memory
	* because of traffic.

**processing delay**:
	* time required to modify each packet
	* check errors, and do some other neccessary computations

#### Packet queueing delay
it is not easy to compute queueing delay.
* $R$: link bandwidth (bps)
* $L$: packet length (bits)
* $a$: average packet arrival rate

* *$La/R$ ~ 0: avg. queueing delay small
* $La/R$ -> 1: avg. queueing delay large
* $La/R$> 1: more “work” arriving is more than can be serviced - average delay infinite!

#todo: needs more analogies on traffics

# Traceroute : command to trace route
![[../images/20230905140558.png]]
* separate pings are sent for each hop device
* 3 delay measures

# Packet loss

#todo : fill out packet loss
# Throughput
 > rate at which bits are being sent *from sender to reciever (end-to-end)*.
* determined by minimum bandwidth.
* usually happens near the end user. 
**bottleneck link** : link with minimum bandwidth.



skip security.

# Recap

Traceroute
uses **ICMP**g protocol (same protocol as ping command)

Throughput is different to bandwidth
#todo 1: what is the difference?

#todo 2 : do the excercises

*******
# Protocols

so many different machines, medias, data...
How do they communicate? 

We divide each services as layers
each layer 

OSI layer model. (just in the theory)
7 layers.

TCP/IP layer model. (of today's Internet)
5 layer model. 
* Application
* transport
* network
* link
* physical

4 lower layers (transport - physical) are **implemented in each OS**.
Application layers are implemented in **server software or browser**.

# Service layering

Attach a header for each layer, and pass it to the lower layer.
Router delivers the packet 
## Each chunks have different names
1) in transport layer : 
* Messages are wrapped with header to make a **segment** of the layer
* header_transport + message = **segment**

2) in network layer : 
* header_network + segment = **datagram**

3) in link layer :
* header_link + datagram = **frame**

Switch do **not** consider about network layer They only care link layer & physical layer
Router **do** consider about network layer.

## Examples 
wireshark using examples


# Chapter 2. Application layer

## keywords
> Web, HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, DNS, P2P, video streaming, socket programming(using UDP & TCP)

## Goals
> conceptual & implementation of application layer protocols. 


# This semester makes a network app

text messaging, email, multi-user network games, streaming stored video, p2p, skype, zoom, internet search, remote login, 
* run on end systems.
* communicate over network
* encapsulate 
* no need to write software for network-core device


## Client-Server paradigm
* server
	* always-on host
	* permanent OP address
	* 
* clients

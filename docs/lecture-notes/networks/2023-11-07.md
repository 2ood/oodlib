# Router Architecture

## Input port function
* line termination(Physical layer)
	* bit level reception
* link layer protocol recieving
	* Ethernet
* lookup, forwarding table, queueing
	* queueing happens at every port.
	* decentralized switching
		* Destination-based forwarding
		* SDN (more fields to compare)
	* goal is to process at line speed. so, the calculations are excecuted at hardware level.

## Longest Prefix Matching

## Switching fabric
Switching rate should be $NR$, where $R$ is the speed of each line.
fabric designs are 3 types.
* memory, bus, interconnection network.

## Switching fabric #1. Memory
> past generation. 
* memory is the middle point.
* speed is limited by memory bandwidth.
* need two buses(input bus, output bus)
* read&write is needed.

## Switching fabric #2. Bus
> Bus (64bits of data can flow at a singular clock cycle)

* Popular, but very expensive.
* speed is limited by bus bandwidth (bus contentation)
* cutting-edge buses are 32 Gbps
* bus contentation depends on how many/busy input ports are.
## Switching fabric #3. Interconnection network
> grid, and each pathways can be open or closed.

* Crossbar methods.
* Initially developed for processor connection methods.
* If bus speed is R, and there are NR capacity (at most, by some sort of parallelism)
* thus can meet the efficiency of bus method.
* Even if we have less bandwidth, NR switching rate can be made because parallel switching is possible. 
* up to 60 Gbps.

* limitation : when one pathway blocks other needed pathways. 
* Buffer management, scheduling algorithm should be implemented.


## Output port contention
**HOL Blocking** occurs.  - when two packet destined to the same output port. 
The other packet data should wait until one collection of data is passed.

**Output buffer** comes in. 
When arrival rate exceeds output line speed.
but queueing delay and loss due to output port buffer overflow can happen. 

## Buffer management is required. 
3 tasks on buffer management
1) what should be the buffering size
2) drop policy (which to drop?)
3) scheduling discipline giving priority on each packets

## How much buffering?
```
${RTT*c}/{\sqrt{N}}$
```
Round Trip time is used. 
#todo : write about TCP flow and buffer.

If you have too much buffer?

## Buffer management
#### Drop policy
#### priority

#### round robin

#todo : fill out.

## Network priority
#todo : fill out

## Network Neutrality

* technical, social, economic, legal

Three rules made in US, 2015
* No blocking
* No throttling
* no paid prioritization

******
# Network Layer Protocol

* IP protocol
* ICMP protocol (used in ping service)

# IP datagram format
#todo : paste format image.
* source IP address
* destination IP address
* TTL : max hops, thus looping packets are prevented.
* upper layer protocol  (TCP, UDP..)
* header checksum (calculation to validate the data is intact). for some reliability
	* header checksum is only for header parts.
* 16bit identifier, flags, fragment offset
	* router also does fragmentation. (actually a link layer process, but since they do not have processing power, network layer does it.)

# Recap

Application layer
# Paradigms of network apps
## Client-Server paradigm
* Server 
	* Always on host
	* permanent IP address
	* need to think about scaling, security.
	* Could be hosting on standalone, or on data center
	* Data center hosting is superior in scaling and security.

* Clients
	* maybe intermittently connected.
	* could be dynamic IP address. (DHCP)
	* **DO NOT** communicate direct with each other. 

Protocols in Client-Server paradigm
	: HTTP, IMAP, FTP

## Peer-to-Peer paradigm
> Every device is server, and a client.
* no always-on server.
* peers request service from other peers, provide service in return. 
* **Self scalability** : new peers bring new service capacity, along with the demands.

* complex. 

> We'll only focus on Client-server paradigms & HTTP.

# Process Communicating

## What is a Process?
> program running within a host

Client process, server process
inter-process communications : process (hosted in different devices) communicating by exchanging data.

## Socket
> Points where two things are connected.

## How do you identify the socket?
> IP + Port

By IP address (device) + Port (process inside the device) 
ex. http servers run on port 80, https servers run on port 443

Analogy. Envelope. 
Family members share a same home address (IP), and we have a name (port)

UDP socket, TCP socket.

> Google didn't like any of the transport layer.
> So they made QUIC(Quick UDP Internet Connections)

> A browser (also) runs on a prot number


## Protocol defines..
* Types of messages (Res, Req)
* message syntax (How fields are delineated)
* message semantics (meaning of info)
* rules (when and how processes send & respond to messages)

## Open Protocols
defined in RFCs, everyone can read and use
allows for interoperability
ex, HTTP, SMTP

There also are (not-open) proprietary protocols.

## Transport service
What criteria should we care when **choosing** transport service for an application??
	* data integrity (making sure the files are completely transferred)
		* Okay if you can tolerate the data loss (Ex. audio format file)
	* timing (low delay)
		* Okay if the service is not live-streaming
	* throughput (bandwidth of edge..)
		* Okay if service is elastic.

## Properties of TCP & UDP

| |TCP|UDP|
|---|---|---|
|transport reliability| Y| N|
|flow control| Y| N|
|Conjestion control| Y |N |
|**connection-oriented**| Y| N|

TCP Do not provide:
	depends on the bandwidth. Cannot change throughput by itself.
	timing, minimum throughput guarantee, security

UDP Do not provide :
	reliability, flow control, congestion, control, timeing, throughput guarantee, security, connection setup..

throughput is not guarantee by any Protocols in this Internet.
Security is not supported by TCP & UDP
TCP cares about lost packets. UDP doesn't.
TCP is connection-oriented. We should open and close a connection.

Q. Why use UDP?
> **UDP is much faster. Header is smaller.** less overhead.

## Securing TCP
* TCP, UDP has no encryption
* cleartext. human-readable.

We use TLS (Transport Layer Security, Originally called SSL)
	* There are TLS libraries you can use in application layer. 

*****
# Web, HTTP
The idea is "Sending meaningful objects through internet"

* URL : includes information about the target device & what you want

## HTTP
> Hypertext transfer protocol

* **application layer protocol**
* browser is the interpreter(of the HTTP packets) + displayer(of the object).

> **HTTP uses TCP**.
> **HTTP is stateless.** : state information is implemented by cookies.
> **HTTP nowadays (HTTP 1.1) are Persistent.** : 1 connection can be used for multiple objects sending. before closed. You choose how long, how many.

Non-persistent HTTP has high RTT (round trip time)

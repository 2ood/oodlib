# Recap

What kind of Application need which transport protocol?

TCP & UDP have no encryptions, throughput guarantee, timing,,

Web and HTTP 

HTTP uses TCP
TCP is closed after a certain amount of time, or certain amount of transmissions
HTTP is stateless. headers do not store any stateful meanings.

Non-persistent TCP no longer used. High RTT
One single connection on one transmssion

*****
# request and response
all human readable.  Written in ASCII codes)
## HTTP request message
composed of 
	* request line (method, url, version)
	* header lines (header values)
	* body (data)

in the request message,
* GET, POST, HEAD, PUT request types
* lines are broken down by `\r\n`

For normal GET request, there's no body

## GET
 * send data to server by URL query (after question mark).

## POST
* form input

## HEAD 
* request headers only. 
* only used when checking server up status.
* will only send essential info

## PUT
* **upload a file**; alternative for FTP.
* completely replaces file that exist at specified URL

## Response message
composed of
 * status line (HTTP/1.1 200 OK)
 * header lines 
 * body

in the header 
	* Date, Server, Last-Modified, 
	* Etag, 
	* Accept-Ranges,
	* (Content-Length, Content-Type..)
	* and more..

Etag is used for caching page purposes.
version controlling for page.
ex . ( Etag : "abb-43kfnnldocmmdkvndls")

#todo : what is Accept-Ranges

### Response status codes
|code|name|description|
|--|--|--|
|200|OK|success|
|301|Moved Permanently| request object moved, new location specified|
|400| Bad request| not understood by server|
|404| Not found| not found|
|505| HTTP Version Not supported|-|

and more..

## Cookies
> client-side tool to make WEB stateful.
* **in HTTP, all request are independent of each other**
* browser stores the cookie
* widely used in server identifying a client browser&machine
	* Authorization, shopping carts, recommendations, user session state(e-mail..)
	
* when written in browser, it transcends time and can be used in the long apart future and show the seamless cookie-specific action.

four components of data storages
 * cookie **header line** ( of response message)
 * cookie header in next HTTP request message)
 * **cookie file kept on user's host, managed by user's**
 * back-end database at web site

#todo : check the python example on the slides. 
```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://www.google.com")

if response.status_code == 200:
	cookies = response.cookies
	for cookie in cookies:
		print(f"Cookie Name: {cookie.name}")
		print(f"Cookie value: {cookie.value}")

else :
	print("HTTP Error:",response.status_code,response.reason)
```

```
Cookie Name: 1P_JAR
Cookie value: 2023-09-14-04
Cookie Name: AEC
Cookie value: Ad49MVFXS3NX5m3l8PO4X5FUaFZvQI8b1Czl9-Ym1cAxZn7fTXSC5fXdAw
Cookie Name: NID
Cookie value: 511=m0D8Dti7MEGMgrBAZI_1a3ZfZ8xr9ydTVeHn60MicQtJztyPIo5Qj7U73zEnhAm8i1KeRJfAjsANOwpxvqaKfemnBYIWKnfl_OZOjFbDw6rMPjH_aEG9PFVAp20YMu8ZOpIaj7b7NBSauxhKPq3-ceyC3o-pyKj-X-5_T1G0ou4

```


* Cookie has **trade-offs on privacy**
	* it is a info a lot about you.
* How to keep state? (other than cookies?)*
	* cookies inside the HTTP message
	* protocol endpoint ?
	* #todo what is protocol endpoint 

# Web Caches
> Intermediate servers that saves a server and sending pages instead of the origin server

* satisfy client request without involving origin server
* Act as a client against origin server, act as a server for end-users
* server tells cache about whether the object can be cached or not
	* `Cache-Control: max-age=<seconds>` 
 
### advantage
* makes less load on the origin server
* reduce response time
* reduces traffic on the backbone network


following is a small server
```python
from flask import Flask, make_response

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
	response = make_response("hello, world")
	respon.headers["Cache-Control"]= 'public, amx-age=3600'
	return response

if __name__ == '__main__':
	app.run()
```


### Caching Scenario
![[../images/20230914140127.png]]
$$
L = 100K\;bits\;
a = 15/sec\;
R = 1.54 MBps\;

access link utilization = La/R = .97
LAN utilization = 0.0015
delay : 2sec + access link delay(minutes) + LAN delay 
$$

So slow. How will it be 해결?

1. buy a faster link `high R`
		cost-ineffective
2. install a web cache
	#todo : make performance calculations

# Conditional GET
> Don't send object if cache has up-to-date cached version

* no object transmission delay

Client sends a If-modified-since header message of cache that they have
**304 Not modified** status code tells us "you don't need a newer one"
